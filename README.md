# Personal Projects

### [Crate Mates](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1750600/Crate_Mates/)

<img src="art/crate_mates_banner.PNG"/>

Crate Mates is a puzzle game where the player controls "mates" to store "crates". It's an original take on a very old puzzle game formula.

### [City Maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1540910/City_Maker/)

<img src="art/city_maker_banner.PNG"/>

A mix between a city building game and a casual puzzle game. The player builds a city but the catch is that they can only pick from 3 possible buildings at any given time. They have to learn to both make sure that the cities organization fulfils the needs of its citizens and that the infrastructure cost don't exceed the city's revenue.

### [Postman Tap](https://postmantap.com/)

<img src="art/postman_tap_banner.jpg"/>

Building on a game I mention further down, the player controls a postman on a mission to deliver mail in a small airborne village.

It's a simple casual mobile game with a light meta progression.

### [Orders of the King](https://gibss.github.io/test/orders-of-the-king/v0.1)

<img src="art/order_of_the_king_banner.jpg"/>

Online multiplayer game (can be played alone) where the player defines a strategy using [behaviour trees](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisSimpson/20140717/221339/Behavior_trees_for_AI_How_they_work.php) for your medieval army to follow.
Your goal is to annex the most villages and levy the most taxes off of them.

### [Glider boy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.shieldboy)

<img src="art/glider_boy_banner.jpg"/>

A very modest infinite runner for mobile. My first attempt at making an ultra casual mobile game and first solo project.

# Playable prototypes

Fully playable prototypes, usually missing art and too rough to be worth bringing to completion.

### [Vertical scape](https://gibss.github.io/test/vertical-scape/v0.4)

<img src="art/vertical_scape_banner.jpg"/>

A mix between a terraria like game and a colony management game. It's very light on content and mostly showcases a very simple core loop.

### [Goo ship](https://gibss.github.io/test/goo-ship/Prototype)

<img src="art/goo_ship_banner.jpg"/>

FTL meets worms: The player controls a ship in a 2D-platformer environment and uses its different systems (weapons, augmentations..) to defeat enemy ships. The worms bit is that both ships and the world is destructible.

Make sure to play in fullscreen mode.

### [Cannon automaton](https://gibss.github.io/test/cannon-automaton-2)

<img src="test/cannon-automaton-2/Images/cannon-automaton-III.PNG"/>

Harvest resources to be able to purchase defenses and protect yourself from incoming waves of enemies. There is no tutorial so this might be a bit rough to learn but the jist of it is: place mining lasers to harvest resources, spend those resources to place more miners or more defenses. The enemies come from the right hand side of the screen.

### [Horizon Army](https://gibss.github.io/test/landmark-project/v0.5/index.html)

Digital card game of sorts where the player collects medieval fantasy soldiers. With those soldiers they try to create the most optimal army to compete online against other players' armies. It is almost finished, the main missing piece as you can see is the art. Although it is hard to make out, it is fully playable and there is a short tutorial to onboard the player on how to make armies.

### [Minute Miner](https://gibss.github.io/test/minute-miner/v0.2/index.html)

The player must last 20 minutes by harvesting minerals and buying defenses in an ever growing mine. 

### [Grapple](https://gibss.github.io/test/grapple-world/index.html)

A prototype for the first level of a super meat boy, celeste, vvvvv like 2d platformer. The player moves through space using a grappling hook.

### [Arrows](https://gibss.github.io/test/arrows/index.html)

Messing around with the concept for a 2D platformer focused around archery, destructible terrain and fighting large enemies.

# Libraries

### [Unity Mask Lighting](https://github.com/GibsS/unity-mask-lighting)

A library to reproduce a specific type of lighting in 2D games.

### [Unity Behaviour Tree](https://github.com/GibsS/unity-behaviour-tree)

There is probably a plethora of behaviour tree libraries for Unity but most of them focus on making it "designer" friendly and UI driven. I wanted to make a library that gave programmers a simple framework to create complex AI behaviours through behaviour trees. So I made this library. One of it's main feature is the use of C# IEnumerables to allow developers to write dynamic behaviour tree nodes and have a lot of control without having to create over complicated trees with hundreds of nodes.

### [Gridlike](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grid-like)

When looking at javascript 2D physics engines for HTML5 games, I felt like it was always painful to have some wrapper code around the physics library in order to do very simple things like create a controlable character, have him stay still on moving platforms..

So I made Gridlike: A typescript physics engine (compiled to javascript) designed for creating 2d voxel games and designed to make character implementation extremely quick.

A simple Unity script to implement 2D camera control for mobile games and desktop alike.
